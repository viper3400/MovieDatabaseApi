# MovieDatabaseApi

This repository is part of the initative described here: https://homeweb.readthedocs.io/de/latest/DevelopersDocumentation/en/renovation.html
The handbook itself belongs to the the legacy version and is outdated, though functionality is mostly ported.

Mainly it's the backend for our private DVD & BD-ROM collection.
I also plan to open source the frontend parts in future.

At the moment, there is no more documentation about this project. I'll maybe add some more in future.
I assume, that you won't be able to get all the parts of the application to run in a reasonable time  without documentation.
If you're really interested in this project, please raise an issue to get in contact and desribe your needs.
